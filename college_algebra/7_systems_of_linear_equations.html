<h2>Systems of Linear Equations</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Let $a_1$, $a_2$, $\dots$, $a_n$ be real numbers and $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_n$ real variables. Any
    equation that can be written as \[a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n=0\] is called a linear equation.</p>
<p>Some examples of linear equations are \[ax_1+bx_2=0\] \[ax_1+bx_2=3\] \[\sqrt2 x_1+abx_2=0\]</p>
<p>Some examples of equations that are not linear are \[\sqrt{x_1}+x_2=0\] \[x_1x_2=0\]</p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A collection of linear equations \begin{gather}
    a_{11}x_{1} &+& a_{12}x_{2} &+& \cdots &+& a_{1n}x_n &=& 0\\
    a_{21}x_{1} &+& a_{22}x_{2} &+& \cdots &+& a_{2n}x_n &=& 0\\
    \end{gather}
    \[\vdots\]
    \begin{gather}
    a_{m1}x_{1} &+& a_{m2}x_{2} &+& \cdots &+& a_{mn}x_n &=& 0
    \end{gather}
    if called a system of linear equations.</p>
<p>We will focus on equations in two variables. For example: \begin{alignat}{2}
    2x &{}-{}& 3y &{}= 4\\
    x &{}+{}& 6y &{}= -1
    \end{alignat}</p>
<p>We can use substitution or elimination to solve systems of linear equations.</p>
<p>Substitution involves isolating a variable and substituting it into another equation. With our example, it is
    easiest to isolate $x$ in the second equation to get $x=-1-6y$, which can be substituted into the first equation
    to get $2(-1-6y)-3y=4$, a single linear equation in one variable, $y$, which we can solve to get $y=$. We
    substitute this value of $y$ into $x=-1-6y$ to get $x=$.</p>
<p>Elimination is much easier. We multiply equations by real numbers and add them in such a way that eliminates
    one of the variables. For example, if we multiply the first equation by $2$ and add it to the second equation,
    notice that $y$ will be eliminated, leaving us a single linear equation in one variable, $x$. Alternatively,
    if we multiply the second equation by $-2$ and add it to the first equation, $x$ will be eliminated, leaving us
    a single linear equation in one variable, $y$. Once we solve the linear equation in one variable, we can
    substitute solution into one of the equations to solve for the other variable. </p>
<p>Both methods become substantially more difficult when dealing with a large amount of variables and equations.
    Real world problems involve systems of hundreds of thousands of variables and equations. The problem of solving
    any system of linear equations is
    solved, i.e., there is an algorithm that a computer can use to solve any linear system of equations.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>The object \[\begin{pmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} & 0\\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} & 0\\
    \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots & \vdots\\
    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} & 0\\
    \end{pmatrix}\]</p> is called the matrix representation of the system of linear equations above.
