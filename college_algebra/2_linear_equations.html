    <!--<h1>Some Thoughts</h1>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>For us*, it is important to distinguish between mathematical objects and statements about mathematical objects.
<p>For example, "$1$", "$8$", "$1-8$", and "$3$" are mathematical objects, but "$1-8<3$" is a statement
    about mathematical objects.</p></p>
<p>When a collection of mathematical symbols forms a mathematical object that makes sense, we call it an
    expression.</p>
<p>For example, $5-3\cdot 2$ is an expression, but $5)2\cdot+$ is not.</p>
<p>When two mathematical objects are related using the "$=$" symbol, we call the relation an equation.</p>
<p>For example, "$2x-4=-9$" is an equation.</p><-->

        <span class="result-title">2.1.1 Definitions</span>
        Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers and $x$ a real variable. Any
        equation that can be written as \[ax+b=0\] is called a <span class="definition">linear equation in one
            variable</span>, assuming $a\ne0$.
        We <span class="definition">solve a linear equation</span> by using properties E1&mdash;E4 of real numbers to isolate
        the
        variable
        $x$. 
        <section class="basic_examples">
            <h3>2.1.2 Basic Examples</h3>
            <p>We will look at 7 basic examples.</p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$x+3=17$.</span> By
                subtracting $3$ from both sides of the equation, <span class="display">$x=14$.</span>
            </div>
            <p>The following are a couple of similar examples, each of which can be solved simply by subtracting (or
                adding)
                a
                real number.</p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$x+\frac32=5$.</span> By
                subtracting $\frac32$ from both sides of the equation, <span class="display">$x=\frac72$.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$x-1000=350$.</span> By
                adding $1000$ to both sides of the equation, <span class="display">$x=1350$.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Next, a slightly different example.</p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$3x=6$.</span> By dividing
                both sides of the equation by $3$, <span class="display">$x=2$.
                </span>
            </div>
            <p>The following are a couple of similar examples, each of which can be solved simply by dividing (or
                multiplying) by a
                real number.</p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$3x=6$.</span> By dividing
                both sides of the equation by $3$, <span class="display">$x=2$.
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="boxed example">

                </span>
            </div>
            <p>The following example is an important special case similar to the previous example. We will use the
                following
                fact:
                $-x=-1\cdot x$, so <span class="display"><span class="tech">$-1$</span>$\cdot-x=$ <span
                        class="tech">$-1$</span> $\cdot-1\cdot
                    x=1\cdot x=x$.</span></p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$-x=54$.</span> By
                multiplying both sides of the equation by <span class="tech">$-1$</span>, <span
                    class="display">$x=-54$.

            <h3>2.1.3 Sophisticated Examples</h3>
            <p>Next, we increase the level of
                sophistication by
                requiring both subtraction and division.</p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$9x-2=-4$.</span> By
                adding $2$ to both sides of the equation, <span class="display">$9x=-2$.</span> By dividing both sides
                of the
                equation by $9$, <span class="display">$x=-\frac29$.
                </span>
            </div>
            <p>The following are a couple of similar examples, each of which can be solved simply by first subtracting
                (or
                adding) by a real number and then dividing (or multiplying) by a real number.</p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$9x-2=-4$.</span> By
                adding $2$ to both sides of the equation, <span class="display">$9x=-2$.</span> By dividing both sides
                of the
                equation by $9$, <span class="display">$x=-\frac29$.
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="boxed example">

                of the
                equation by $9$, <span class="display">$x=-\frac29$.
                </span>
            </div>
            <p>Next we look at a few examples which can be solvied by first dividing (or multiplying) by a real number
                and then
                subtracting (or adding) by a real number.</p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$5(x+4)=25$.</span> By
                dividing both sides of the equation by $5$, <span class="display">$x+4=5$.</span> By subtracting $4$
                from both
                sides of the equation, <span class="display">$x=1$.
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$\frac{x+8}{12}=3$
                    .</span> By
                multiplying both sides of the equation by $12$, <span class="display">$x+8=36$.</span> By subtracting
                $8$ from
                both sides of the equation, <span class="display">$x=28$.
                </span>
            </div>
            <p>Linear equations in one variable do not get much more sophisticated. Solving them is just a matter of
                applying a
                sequence of subtractions (or additions) and divisions (or multiplications) by real numbers.</p>
            <div class="boxed example">
                <span class="result-title">Example</span> Solve <span class="display">$\frac{\frac{5x-1}{4}+9}{2}=a$
                    .</span> By
                multiplying both sides of the equation by $12$, <span class="display">$x+8=36$.</span> By subtracting
                $8$ from
                both sides of the equation, <span class="display">$x=28$.
