<h1>Linear Inequalities</h1>
<div class="definition">
    <span class="result-title">Definition</span>
    The relations $\le$, $\ge$, $<$, $>$, and $\ne$ are called <span
        class="definition">inequality relations</span> and are read <span class="definition">less than or equal to</span>,
    <span class="definition">greater than or equal to</span>, <span class="definition">less than</span>,
    <span class="definition">greater than</span>, and <span class="definition">not equal to</span>. The relations $<$, $>$, and
    $\ne$ are called <span class="definition">strict
		inequality relations</span>. When the equality relation $=$ in a linear equation is replaced by any
    inequality relation, the resulting relationship is called a <span
        class="definition">linear inequality</span>.
