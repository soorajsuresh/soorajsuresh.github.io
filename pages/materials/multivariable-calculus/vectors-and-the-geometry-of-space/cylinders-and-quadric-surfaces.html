<div class="definition">
  Let $P$ be a plane containing a curve $C$, and let $L$ be a line not parallel to $P$. A <span class="definition">cylinder</span> is a surface generated by moving a line parallel to $L$ through $C$. The curve $C$ is called the <span class="definition">generating curve</span> for the cylinder.
</div>

<div class="example">
  Provide a sketch in $\R^3$ of the surface given by the equation $x=z^2$.
</div>

<div class="definition">
  A <span class="definition">quadric surface</span> is the graph in space of a second-degree equation in $x$, $y$, and $z$
  <div class="display">$Ax^2+By^2+Cz^2+Dxy+Exz+Fyz+Gx+Hy+Iz+J=0,$</div>
  where $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, $G$, $H$, $I$, and $J$ are constants, with at least one of $A$, $B$, and $C$ nonzero. Our examples will often have $D=E=F=0$ for simplicity, to maintain alignment of the quadric surface with the coordinate axes. The basic quadric surfaces are <span class="definition">paraboloids</span>, <span class="definition">ellipsoids</span>, <span class="definition">hyperboloids</span>, <span class="definition">cones</span>.
</div>

<div class="example">
  Provide a geometric description and sketch the surface given by the following equation in $\R^3$.
  <div class="display">$\frac{x^2-8x}{16}+{y^2-9y}+\frac{z^2}{\e^2}=-\frac{69}4$</div>
</div>

<p>By completing the square twice and performing algebra, we get</p>
<div class="display">$\frac{\parens{x-4}^2}{64}+\frac{\parens{y-\frac92}^2}{4}+\frac{z^2}{4\e^2}=1.$</div>

<p>This surface is an ellipsoid centered at $(4,\,9/2,\,0)$ with semi-axes parallel with the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$- axes of lengths $8$, $2$, and $2\e$, respectively.</p>
