<h2 class="section-heading">Vectors</h2>

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">[REWORK]</span>

A <span class = "definition">vector</span> is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction.

To distinguish vectors from numbers, vectors should be typeset in boldface ($\a$) and handwritten with an arrow or bar above them like $\overline{a}$ or $\vec{a}$.
	
A <span class = "definition">vector</span> is (represented by) an arrow. The arrow points in the direction of the vector and its length represents the <span class = "definition">magnitude</span> of the vector. If the arrow starts at a point $A$ and ends at another point $B$, then we write <div class="display">$\a=\overrightarrow{AB}$,</div> and $A$ is called the <span class = "definition">initial point</span> or <span class = "definition">tail</span> of the vector and $B$ is called the <span class = "definition">terminal point</span> or <span class = "definition">tip</span> or <span class = "definition">head</span> of the vector.

<p>
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">[displacement]</span>
	Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be points in space. If a particle moves from $A$ to $B$ and then from $B$ to $C$, then, in total, it has moved from $A$ to $C$. If $\a=\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\b=\overrightarrow{BC}$, then $\c=\overrightarrow{AC}$ is called the <span class = "definition">resultant vector</span>. The vector $\c$ is also called the <span class = "definition">sum</span> of $\a$ and $\b$ denoted $\c =\a+\b$.
</p>

<p>If two vectors have the same direction, they are said to be <span class = "definition">parallel</span>.</p>

<p>If $\a$ is a vector, then $-\a$ is the vector with the same magnitude as $\a$ but opposite direction.</p>

<p>
  If $\a$ is a vector, then $2\a$ is a vector parallel to $\a$ that is twice as long as $\a$. In general, if $k$ is a number, then $k\a$ is a vector $k$ times as long as $\a$ in the same direction of $\a$ if $k>0$ and in the opposite direction if $k<0$. The number $k$ is called a <span class = "definition">scalar</span> and the vector $k\a$, read as $k$ times $\a$, is called the <span class = "definition">scalar product</span> of $k$ and $\a$ and is also called a <span class = "definition">scalar multiple</span> of $\a$. Note, $-\a=-1\a$.
</p>

<p>
  If $k\ne0$, then $\frac\a k$ denotes the vector parallel to $\a$ than which $\a$ is $k$ times longer <div class = "display">$\frac\a k=\frac1k\a$.</div>
</p>
	
<p>
  The <span class = "definition">difference</span> of $\a$ and $\b$ is the vector $\a-\b=\a+(-\b)$.
</p>
	
<p>
  Two vectors are <span class = "definition">equal</span> if they have the same length and direction.
</p>

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">[example here]</span>

<p>There are infinitely many vectors equal to $\overrightarrow{AB}$, each with a distinct initial point. Exactly one of these vectors has an intial point at the origin. This vector is said to be in \defn{standard position} and it is called the \defn{position vector} of $\overrightarrow{AB}$. Note, a position vector is completely and uniquely determined by its terminal point.</p>

<p>
  If a position vector $\a$ has a terminal point in space described in rectangular coordinates as $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$, then it is denoted \[\a=\inner{a_1,a_2,a_3}.\] This notation is called the \defn{component form} of $\a$ and the numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ are called the \defn{components} of $\a$. The symbols $\langle$ and $\rangle$ are called <span class = "definition">angle brackets</span>.
</p>

<p>
  Two vectors $\a=\inner{a_1,a_2,a_3}$ and $\b=\inner{b_1,b_2,b_3}$ are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal, i.e., $\a=\b$ if and only if $a_1=b_1$, $a_2=b_2$, and $a_3=b_3$.
</p>

<p>
  The magnitude (or length) of $\a$ is denoted by $\abs{\a}$.
</p>

<div class = "theorem">
  If $\a=\inner{a_1,a_2,a_3}$, then $\abs{\a}=\sqrt{a_1^2+a_2^2+a_3^2}$.
</div>
	
<p>The \defn{zero vector}, denoted $\bm 0=\inner{0,0,0}$ has magnitude $0$ and has no direction.</p>

<div class = "theorem">
  If $P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $Q=(x_2,y_2,z_2)$, then <div class="display">$\overrightarrow{PQ}=\inner{x_2-x_1,\,y_2-y_1,\,z_2-z_1}$,</div> and <div class="display">$\abs{\overrightarrow{PQ}}=\sqrt{\parens{x_2-x_1}^2+\parens{y_2-y_1}^2+\parens{z_2-z_1}^2}$.</div>

<p>A vector of magnitude $1$ is called a \defn{unit vector}.</p>

<p>The \defn{standard unit vectors} in space are $\i=\inner{1,0,0}$, $\j=\inner{0,1,0}$, and $\k=\inner{0,0,1}$. In the plane, the standard unit vectors are $\i=\inner{1,0}$ and $\j=\inner{0,1}$.</p>

The components $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ are called the \defn{i-component}, \defn{j-component}, and \defn{k-component}, respectively, of $\inner{a_1,a_2,a_3}$.

  A vector $\a$ in $\R^n$ is denoted $\a=\inner{a_1,\,a_2,\,\dots,\,a_n}$, where the real numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, $\dots$, $a_n$ are called the components of $\a$.

  <p>The <span class="definition">sum</span> of $\inner{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n}$ and $\inner{b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n}$ is defined as <div class="display">$\inner{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n}+\inner{b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n}=\inner{a_1+b_1,\,a_2+b_2,\,\dots,\,a_n+b_n}$.</div> If $k\in\R$ is a scalar, then the scalar multiple of $k$ and $\inner{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n}$ is defined as <div class="display">$k\inner{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n}=\inner{ka_1,\,ka_2,\,\dots,ka_n}$.</div></p>
