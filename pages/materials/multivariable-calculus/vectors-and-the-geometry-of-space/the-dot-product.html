<div class="definition">
	A <span class="defn">displacement</span> is a directed distance, i.e., a vector representing the shortest path from one point to another, e.g., $\overrightarrow{AB}$.
</div>

<p>
In [previous section], if a force vector $\F$ was applied to a particle at an angle of $\theta$ radians from the horizontal, then we expressed $\F$ in component form as <div class="display">$\F=\inner{\abs\F\cos\theta,\abs\F\sin\theta}$.</div> The number $\abs\F\cos\theta$ represents the component of $\F$ effective in moving the particle in the horizontal direction, and $\abs\F\sin\theta$ represents the component of $\F$ effective in moving the particle in the vertical direction.
</p>

<p>
It will be necessary to know the components of $\F$ effective in moving the particle in other directions as well. Specifically, if $\F$ moves a particle through a displacement $\D$, then we will need to know the component of $\F$ effective in moving the particle through $\D$ (where $\D$ may not be parallel to a coordinate axis).
</p>

<p>
The component of $\F$ effective in moving the particle through $\D$ is $\abs\F\cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\F$ and $\D$. Our first objective is to find an efficient way to compute the angle between two vectors.
</p>

<div class="definition">
	When two nonzero vectors $\a$ and $\b$ are arranged such that their tails coincide, they form an angle $\theta$ measured between $0$ and $\pi$ radians in the plane containing $\a$ and $\b$. This angle $\theta$ is called <span class="defn">the angle between $\a$ and $\b$</span>. If $\a$ and $\b$ have the same direction, then $\theta=0$, and if $\a$ and $\b$ are opposite in direction, then $\theta=\pi$.
</div>

<div class="example">
	Determine the angle $\theta$ between the two nonzero vectors $\a=\inner{a_1,a_2,a_3}$ and $\b=\inner{b_1,b_2,b_3}$.
</div>

<div class="definition">
	If $\a=\inner{a_1,a_2,a_3}$ and $\b=\inner{b_1,b_2,b_3}$, then the quantity $a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3$ is denoted by $\a\cdot\b$, read “$\a$ dot $\b$”, and called the <span class="defn">dot product</span> of $\a$ and $\b$:
	<div class="display">$ \a\cdot\b=a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3 $.</div>
	
	<p>
	With this notation, the angle between two nonzero vectors $\a$ and $\b$ in space is
	</p>
	<div class="display">$ \theta=\acos\parens{\frac{\a\cdot\b}{\abs\a\abs\b}} $.</div>
</div>

<p>
Note, this operation between two vectors results in a scalar.
</p>

<div class="example">
	Find $\a\cdot\b$ if $\a=\inner{2,0,-2}$, $\b=\inner{1,1,3}$.
</div>

<div class="example">
	A water main is to be constructed with a 10% grade in the north direction and a 20% grade in the east direction. Determine the angle required in the water main for the turn from north to east.
</div>

<p>
By the first example, we have the following theorem.
</p>

<div class="theorem">
	If $\a$ and $\b$ are nonzero vectors in space and $\theta$ is the angle between them, then
	<div class="display">$ \a\cdot\b=\abs\a\abs\b\cos\theta $.</div>
</div>

<p>
This theorem allows us to easily compute the dot product of two vectors when their magnitudes and the angle between them are more readily accessible than their components.
</p>

<div class="example">
	Present $\a\cdot\b$, where $\abs{\a}=4$ and $\abs{\b}=5$ and the angle between $\a$ and $\b$ is $\theta=\frac\pi3$.
</div>

<div class="example">
	For an equilateral triangle $ABC$, present $\a\cdot\b$ if $\a=\overrightarrow{AB}$ has a magnitude of $4$, and $\b=\overrightarrow{BC}$.
</div>

<div class="example">
	Let $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$ be the vertices of a regular hexagon $ABCDE$, and let $\overrightarrow{DE}$ be a unit vector. Present $\u\cdot\v$ where $\u=\overrightarrow{AC}$ and $\v=\overrightarrow{AD}$.
</div>

<p>
Recall that the component of the force $\F$ effective in moving a particle through a displacement $\D$ is $\abs\F\cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\F$ and $\D$.
</p>

<div class="definition">
	The number $\abs\F\cos\theta$ is called the <span class="defn">scalar projection</span> of $\F$ onto $\D$ and is denoted $\scal_\D\F$. The vector with this magnitude in the direction of $\D$ is called the <span class="defn">vector projection</span> of $\F$ onto $\D$ and is denoted $\proj_\D\F$.
</div>

<p>
Note that $\scal_\D\F$ is negative when $\frac\pi2<\theta\le\pi$.
</p>

<div class="example">
	For two vectors $\a$ and $\b$ in space with angle $\theta$ between them where $\b$ is nonzero, express $\scal_\b\a$ and $\proj_\b\a$ in terms of a dot product.
</div>

<div class="example">
	Suppose that a box is being towed up an inclined plane with an incline of $\alpha$ radians. The towing force <strong>T</strong> is applied at an angle of $\beta>\alpha$ radians from the horizontal. Present the force $\abs{\text{\textbf{T}}}$ that makes the component of <strong>T</strong> parallel to the inclined plane equal to $F$ pounds.
</div>

<p>In integral calculus, the work done by a constant force $\F$ applied in the direction of the displacement $\D$ to move the particle through $\D$ was $W=\abs\F\abs\D$. (In integral calculus, we did not need vectors, and we just wrote $W=FD$. Here, we have rewritten that idea using vector notation to relate our old idea of work to the more general definition of work below.)</p>

<p>If a constant force $\F$ is applied in a direction different from the direction of the displacement $\D$ to move a particle through $\D$, then work is not done by the full magnitude of the force, but only by the component of $\F$ that is in the direction of $\D$, so</p>
<div class="display">$W=(\scal_\D\F)\abs\D$.</div>

<p>Note, $W=(\scal_\D\F)\abs\D=(\abs\F\cos\theta)\abs\D=\abs\F\abs\D\cos\theta=\F\cdot\D$.</p>

<div class="definition">
  The <span class="definition">work</span> done by a constant force $\F$ moving a particle through a displacement $\D$ is
  <div class="display">$W=\F\cdot\D$.</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
  Present the work required to slide a crate 30 m along a loading dock by pulling on it with a 220-N force at an angle of 30$^\circ$ from the horizontal.
</div>

<div class="example">
  Let $\a$ and $\b$ be nonzero vectors in space and $\theta$ the angle between them.  
  Show that if $\theta=\frac\pi2$, then $\a\cdot\b=0$ and, conversely, if $\a\cdot\b=0$, then $\theta=\frac\pi2$.
</div>

<p>Furthermore, $\a\cdot\b>0$ if and only if $\theta$ is acute, and $\a\cdot\b<0$ if and only if $\theta$ is obtuse.</p>

<div class="definition">
  In our course, vectors are arrows. Saying that arrows are <span class="definition">perpendicular</span> means that the angle between them is $\frac\pi2$, which happens if and only if $\a\cdot\b=0$, by the previous example.

  In general, the vectors $\a$ and $\b$ are said to be <span class="definition">orthogonal</span> and denoted $\a\perp\b$ to mean that $\a\cdot\b=0$.

  In our course, the words perpendicular and orthogonal are interchangeable.

  The zero vector $\bm0$ is considered orthogonal to all vectors.
</div>

<div class="example">
  Present examples of nonzero vectors $\a$, $\b$, and $\c$ in space such that $\a\perp\b$ but $\a\not\perp\c$.

<p>Similarly, $\v=a\i+b\j$ is parallel to the line $bx-ay=c$.</p>

<div class="example">

  <div class="display">$\frac{\abs{ax_1+by_1+c}}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$.</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
  Show that $(\a-\proj_\b\a)\perp\proj_\b\a$.
</div>

<p>Hint: Since $\proj_\b\a$ is parallel to $\b$, $(\a-\proj_\b\a)\perp\proj_\b\a$ when $(\a-\proj_\b\a)\perp\b$.</p>

<p>Note,</p>
<div class="display">$
\a=\proj_\b\a+(\a-\proj_\b\a)=
\parens{\frac{\a\cdot\b}{\abs\b^2}}\b+\parens{\a-\parens{\frac{\a\cdot\b}{\abs\b^2}}\b}.
$</div>

<p>The <strong>angle between (differentiable) functions at a point</strong> can be defined as the (acute) angle between their tangent lines at that point.</p>

<div class="example">
  If $f$ and $g$ are functions defined by $f(x)=\cosh x-\frac12$ and $g(x)=\sinh x$, determine the angle between $f$ and $g$ at their point of intersection.
</div>

<p>The dot product can be defined between two vectors in $\R^n$.</p>

<p>If $\a=\inner{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n}$ and $\b=\inner{b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n}$, then</p>
<div class="display">$ \a\cdot\b=a_1b_1+a_2b_2+\cdots+a_nb_n $</div>

<p>All the properties and definitions involving the dot product that we have discussed hold for this general definition. We will mostly apply the dot product in space ($\R^3$) and in the plane ($\R^2$).</p>

<div class="example">
  If $\a,\b,\c\in\R^n$, then prove that $\a\cdot(\b+\c)=\a\cdot\b+\a\cdot\c$.
