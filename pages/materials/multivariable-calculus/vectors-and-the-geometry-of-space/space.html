The set of all real numbers is denoted by $\R$. If $S$ is a set, then we write $x\in S$ to denote that $x$ is an element of $S$. For example, $\sqrt2\in\R$.

<p><span class = "definition">The plane</span> is the set $\R^2$ of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$, where $x,y\in\R$.</p>

<p><span class = "definition">Space</span> is the set $\R^3$ of all ordered triplets $(x,y,z)$, where $x,y,z\in\R$.</p>

To represent space graphically, three mutually perpendicular lines called the <span class = "definition">coordinate axes</span> that meet at the point $(0,0,0)$ called the <span class = "definition">origin</span> are arranged to form a <span class = "definition">right-handed coordinate frame</span> such that when you place the base of your right hand on the positive $x$-axis and curl your fingers towards the positive $y$-axis, the direction of the $z$-axis is parallel with the direction of your thumb.

<p>The <span class = "definition">rectangular coordinates</span> $x$, $y$, and $z$ of a point $(x,y,z)$ represent distances along the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes.</p>

<p>The plane formed by the $x$- and $y$- axes is <span class = "definition">the $xy$-plane</span>. The plane formed by $x$- and $z$- axes is <span class = "definition">the $xz$-plane</span>. The plane formed by the $y$- and $z$- axes is <span class = "definition">the $yz$-plane</span>. These three planes are called the <span class = "definition">coordinate planes</span>, and they cut space into eight <span class = "definition">octants</span>. <span class = "definition">The first octant</p> is <div class = "display">$O_1=\build{(x,y,z)}{x\ge0,\, y\ge0,\, z\ge0}$.</div>
