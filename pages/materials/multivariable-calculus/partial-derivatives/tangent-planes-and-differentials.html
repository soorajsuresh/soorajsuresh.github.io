<h2 class="section-heading">Tangent Planes and Differentials</h2>

<div class="example">
Let $\mathbf{r}(t)$ parametrize a smooth space curve $C$ on the level surface $f(x,y,z)=c$ of a differentiable function $f$. 

Describe the relationship between the velocity vector $\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}$ of $C$ and the gradient vector $\nabla f(\mathbf{r}(t))$ of $f$ along $C$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Describe the tangent lines of curves on the level surface $f(x,y,z)=c$ through a point $P_0$.
</div>

<div class="definition">
Let $f$ be differentiable at a point $P_0$ and $S$ be the level surface $f(x,y,z)=c$.

Let $\left.\nabla f\right|_{P_0}$ be nonzero.

The <strong>tangent plane</strong> to $S$ at $P_0$ is the plane through $P_0$ normal to $\left.\nabla f\right|_{P_0}$.

The <strong>normal line</strong> to $S$ at $P_0$ is the line through $P_0$ parallel to $\left.\nabla f\right|_{P_0}$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Present equations for the tangent plane and normal line to the level surface $f(x,y,z)=c$ at $P_0=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Present the tangent plane and normal line to $x^2+y^2+z-9=0$ at $(1,2,4)$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Present equations for the tangent plane to a surface $z=f(x,y)$ at $P_0=(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Present an equation of the tangent plane to the surface $z = x \cos y - y e^x$ at $(0,0,0)$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Present an equation for the line tangent at $(1,1,3)$ to the ellipse $E$ formed by the intersection of the level surfaces $x^2+y^2-2=0$ and $x+z-4=0$.
</div>

<div class="definition">
The <strong>linearization</strong> at a point $(x_0,y_0)$ of a differentiable function $f$ of two variables $x$ and $y$ is
<div class="display">
$L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)$.
</div>
The approximation $f(x,y) \approx L(x,y)$ is called the <strong>standard linear approximation</strong> of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Relate the linearization of a differentiable function $f$ at $P_0=(x_0,y_0)$ to the tangent plane to $z=f(x,y)$ at $P_0$.
</div>

<div class="definition">
The change $\Delta f$ in value of the linearization of $f$ caused by a change in its input from $(x_0,y_0)$ to $(x_0+\Delta x, y_0+\Delta y)$
<div class="display">
$\Delta f = f_x(x_0,y_0) \Delta x + f_y(x_0,y_0) \Delta y$
</div>
is called the <strong>total differential</strong> of $f$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Relate the total differential of a differentiable function $f$ at $P_0=(x_0,y_0)$ to the tangent plane to $z=f(x,y)$ at $P_0$.
</div>

<div class="example">
A cylindrical can is designed to have a radius of 1 inch and a height of 5 inches. If the radius and height are off by $+0.03$ inch and $-0.1$ inch respectively, estimate the resulting change in the volume of the can.
</div>

<p>Linearizations and total differentials can be extended straightforwardly to functions of more than two variables.</p>
