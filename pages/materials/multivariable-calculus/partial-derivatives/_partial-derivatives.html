<h2 class="section-heading">Partial Derivatives</h2>

<p>
Let $(x_0,y_0)$ be a point in the domain of a function $f$ of two real variables $x$ and $y$.
</p>

<p>
The vertical plane $y=y_0$ intersects the surface given by $z=f(x,y)$ in the curve given by $z=f(x,y_0)$.
</p>

<p>
This curve is a plane curve in a plane parallel to the $xz$-plane and is given by a function in a single variable $x$, so we can take its derivative with respect to $x$ at $x=x_0$.
</p>

<p>
This derivative represents the slope of the line tangent to the curve in the plane $y=y_0$ at $x=x_0$.
</p>

<p>
For the function $f$ of two variables $x$ and $y$, this derivative represents the slope of the line tangent to the surface $z=f(x,y)$ which lies in the plane $y=y_0$. The derivative also represents the change in the function value $z=f(x,y)$ caused by a small change in the $x$ value from $x_0$ while $y$ is fixed at $y_0$.
</p>

<p>
This is what we call the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ at the point $(x_0,y_0)$.
</p>

<div class="definition">
The <span class="defn">partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ at the point $(x_0,y_0)$</span> is
<div class="display">$\lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x_0+h,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h}$</div>
if the limit exists.
</div>

<p>
Similarly, the vertical plane $x=x_0$ intersects the surface given by $z=f(x,y)$ in the curve given by $z=f(x_0,y)$.
</p>

<p>
This curve is a plane curve in a plane parallel to the $yz$-plane and is given by a function in a single variable $y$, so we can take its (ordinary) derivative with respect to $y$ at $y=y_0$.
</p>

This derivative represents the slope of the line tangent to the curve in the plane $x=x_0$ at $y=y_0$.

<div class="definition">
The <span class="defn">partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ at the point $(x_0,y_0)$</span> is
<div class="display">$\lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x_0,y_0+h)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h}$</div>
if the limit exists.

<p>
The partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ is denoted by
<div class="display">$\partial f/\partial x, \ \partial_x f, \ f_x, \ \partial z/\partial x$ (among others),</div>
and the notation
<div class="display">$d f/dx$</div>
is meaningless.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ is denoted by
<div class="display">$\partial f/\partial y, \ \partial_y f, \ f_y, \ \partial z/\partial y$ (among others),</div>
and the notation

<p>
The partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ at the point $(x_0,y_0)$ can be denoted by
<div class="display">$\left.\partial f/\partial x\right|_{(x_0,y_0)}$</div>,
and the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ at the point $(x_0,y_0)$ can be denoted by
<div class="display">$\left.\partial f/\partial y\right|_{(x_0,y_0)}$</div>.
</p>

<div class="example">
Find $\partial f/\partial x$ and $\partial f/\partial y$ if $f$ is defined by
<div class="display">$f(x,y) = 3x^3 - 4x^2 y + 4x^y - 3y^y$</div>.
</div>

<div class="example">
Find $\partial f/\partial x$ and $\partial f/\partial y$ if $f$ is defined by
<div class="display">$f(x,y) = \frac{x \arctan(xy)}{\operatorname{atanh}(y)}$</div>.
</div>

<p>
The second-order derivatives of a function $f$ of two variables $x$ and $y$ are
<div class="display">
$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = (\partial f/\partial x)_x = f_{xx}, \quad
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = (\partial f/\partial y)_x = f_{yx}, \quad
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} = (\partial f/\partial x)_y = f_{xy}, \quad
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = (\partial f/\partial y)_y = f_{yy}$.
</div>
</p>

<div class="example">
Find the second order partials of the function $f$ defined by
<div class="display">$f(x,y) = x \cos y + y e^x$</div>.
</div>

<div class="theorem">
Clairaut's Theorem: If $f$ and its partial derivatives $f_x, f_y, f_{xy}, f_{yx}$ are defined on an open region containing a point $(a,b)$ and are all continuous at $(a,b)$, then
<div class="display">$f_{xy}(a,b) = f_{yx}(a,b)$</div>.
</div>

<div class="example">
Find $f_{xy}$ for the function $f$ defined by
<div class="display">$f(x,y) = xy + \sqrt[3]{x \operatorname{asinh} \sqrt[3]{e^{\arctan x}}}$</div>.
</div>

<p>
We called a function of a single variable differentiable if its derivative existed, and differentiability implies continuity for a function of a single variable.
</p>

<p>
For functions of more than one variable, the existence of partial derivatives (both with respect to $x$ and $y$) is not sufficient for the function to be continuous.
</p>

<p>
Roughly speaking, a function of two variables is called differentiable if it can be approximated by the plane
<div class="display">$L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)$</div>.
</p>

<p>
The existence of the partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ is not sufficient for differentiability. However, if the partials are continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$, then $f$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$.
</p>

<p>
For functions of more than one variable, it still holds that differentiability implies continuity.
