<h2 class="section-heading">Functions of Several Variables</h2>

<div class="definition">
Let $D$ be a set of $n$-tuples $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ of real numbers (points in $\R^n$). A <span class="defn">real-valued function</span> $f$ on $D$ takes each $n$-tuple from $D$ as an input and pairs it with a real number output
<div class="display">$w=f(x_1,\dots,x_n).$</div>
The set $D$ of inputs is called the <span class="defn">domain</span> of $f$ and the set of all outputs is called the <span class="defn">range</span> of $f$. In the equation above, $w$ is called a <span class="defn">dependent variable</span> and $x_1,\dots,x_n$ are called <span class="defn">independent variables</span>.
</div>

<p>
It is often the case that for a function $f$ of two independent variables, we call the independent variables $x$ and $y$ and the dependent variable $z$. The domain can be graphed in the $xy$-plane, and the function values form a surface in space.
</p>

<div class="example">
Present a graph of the domain of the function $f$ defined by
<div class="display">$f(x,y)=\frac{xy^2+y^3}{\sqrt{x-2}\parens{y-\cosh x}}.$</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
Present a graph of the domain of the function $f$ defined by
<div class="display">$f(x,y)=\frac1{x^4+4x^3y+6x^2y^2+4xy^3+y^4}.$</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
Present a graph of the domain of the function $f$ defined by
<div class="display">$f(x,y)=\frac1{\sqrt{\parens{x-y}\parens{x-2y}\parens{x-3y}}}.$</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
Factor $18x^4-39x^3+29x^2-9x+1$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Factor $18x^4-39x^3y+29x^2y^2-9xy^3+y^4$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Present a graph of the domain of the function $f$ defined by
<div class="display">$f(x,y)=\frac{\ln\parens{18x^4-39x^3y+29x^2y^2-9xy^3+y^4}}{xy+2y-x\sech x-2\sech x}.$</div>
</div>

<p>
In our past we have used the words <span class="defn">open</span> and <span class="defn">closed</span> to describe <span class="defn">intervals</span> on the number line. What makes an open interval open? What makes a closed interval closed?
</p>

<p>Now we will extend the idea to the plane.</p>

<div class="definition">
A <span class="defn">disk</span> of radius $r&gt;0$ in the $xy$-plane is the set of all points $(x,y)$ satisfying $x^2+y^2&lt;r$.
</div>

<div class="definition">
Let $R$ be a region in the plane. A point in $R$ is called an <span class="defn">interior point</span> of $R$ if it is the center of a disk that lies entirely in $R$. A point in the $xy$-plane is called a <span class="defn">boundary point</span> of $R$ if every disk centered at the point contains points inside and outside of $R$. The set of all interior points of $R$ is called the <span class="defn">interior</span> of $R$ and the set of all boundary points of $R$ is called the <span class="defn">boundary</span> of $R$. A region is called <span class="defn">open</span> if it consists entirely of interior points and <span class="defn">closed</span> if it contains all of its boundary points.
</div>

<div class="definition">
A region in the plane is called <span class="defn">bounded</span> if it is contained in a disk. If a region is not bounded, it is called <span class="defn">unbounded</span>.
</div>

<div class="example">
State (without proof) whether or not the region $R$ in the plane is bounded or unbounded if
<div class="display">$R=\build{(x,y)\in\R^2}{\abs x&lt;1\text,\ \abs y\le1}\text.$</div>
Justify your conclusion with a sketch of the graph of $R$.
</div>

<div class="example">
State (without proof) whether or not the region $R$ in the plane is bounded or unbounded if
<div class="display">$R=\build{(x,y)\in\R^2}{y=\tanh x\text{ or }y=\ln x}\text.$</div>
Justify your conclusion with a sketch of the graph of $R$.
</div>

<div class="example">
State (without proof) whether or not the region $R$ in the plane is bounded or unbounded if
<div class="display">$R=\build{(x,y)}{-\left(x^{2}+y^{2}-1\right)\left(x^{2}+y^{2}-4\right)^4\left(x^{2}+y^{2}-9\right)^5\left(x^{2}+y^{2}-16\right)\ge0}\text.$</div>
Justify your conclusion with a sketch of the graph of $R$.
</div>

<div class="definition">
Let $f$ be a function with a domain in the plane. The set of all points $(x,y,f(x,y))$ in space is called the <span class="defn">graph</span> of $f$. The set of all points $(x,y)$ in the plane such that $f$ has a constant value $f(x,y)=c$ is called a <span class="defn">level curve</span> of $f$.
</div>

<div class="example">
Let $f$ be defined by $f(x,y)=y^2-x^2$. Present a sketch of the graph of $f$, labeling all of its intercepts with the coordinate axes, as well as a sketch of the level curves given by $f(x,y)=-1$, $f(x,y)=0$, and $f(x,y)=1$.
</div>

<p>
The definitions of interior points, boundary points, open sets, closed sets, bounded, and unbounded in space are analogous to the definitions in the plane. Analogously to the intervals and disks considered in $\R^1$ and $\R^2$, respectively, we consider <span class="defn">balls</span> in $\R^3$. If $f$ is a function with a domain in space, then the set of all points $(x,y,z)$ in space such that $f$ has a constant value $f(x,y,z)=c$ is called a <span class="defn">level surface</span> of $f$.
</p>

<div class="example">
Let $f$ be defined by $f(x,y,z)=x^2-4y^2+4z^2$.

<p>Present a sketch of the graph of $f$.</p>

<p>Present a sketch of the level surfaces given by the equations $f(x,y,z)=1$, $f(x,y,z)=0$, and $f(x,y,z)=-1$.</p>
</div>
