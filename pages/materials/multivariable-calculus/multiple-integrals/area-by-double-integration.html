<div class="example">
If $R$ is a closed and bounded region, interpret:
<div class="display">
$\iint_R \, dA$
</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
Find the area of the region $R$ in the $xy$-plane bounded by $y=0$, $y=\tanh x$, and $x = \frac{1}{2}\ln 3$ in the first quadrant.
</div>

<div class="example">
Find the area of the region $R$ in the $xy$-plane bounded above by $y=f(x)$, below by $y=g(x)$, and by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$, where $f$ and $g$ are nonnegative functions.
</div>

<div class="example">
Find the area of the region $R$ in the $xy$-plane bounded above by $y=f(x)$, below by $y=g(x)$, and by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$, where $f$ and $g$ are nonnegative functions.
</div>

<p>Recall that the average value over a closed interval $I = [a,b]$ of a function $f$ of one variable $x$ defined and integrable over $I$ is:</p>
<div class="display">
$\bar f = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx$
</div>

<div class="definition">
The <strong>average value</strong> over a bounded region $R$ in the plane with area $A(R)$ of a function $f$ of two variables $x$ and $y$ defined and integrable on $R$ is:
<div class="display">
$\bar f = \frac{1}{A(R)} \iint_R f(x,y) \, dA$
</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
Present the average value of the function $f(x,y) = 7 x y^2$ on the region bounded by the graphs of the equations $x=y$ and $x=\sqrt{y}$.
</div>
